Arcadia
=======
The integration of the Clojure Programming Language with the Unity 3D game engine.

Status
------
Arcadia is alpha-quality software, and shouldn't be used for anything important yet.

Community
---------
- [Homepage](https://arcadia-unity.github.io/)
- [Gittr/IRC](https://gitter.im/arcadia-unity/Arcadia)
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/arcadiaunity)

Installing
----------
The contents of the repository should be copied to a folder named `Arcadia` in any Unity project's Assets folder to enable Clojure. In the future, this will be available from the Asset Store. Once copied, you have access to the REPL and the Clojure compiler.

#### Download Zip File

1. Create a subfolder of your Assets folder named Arcadia
2. [Download](https://github.com/arcadia-unity/Arcadia/archive/develop.zip) our zip file and extract its contents into Arcadia

#### Git Clone

```
cd path/to/unity/project/Assets
git clone https://github.com/arcadia-unity/Arcadia.git
```

Usage
-----
[USAGE.md](https://github.com/arcadia-unity/Arcadia/blob/develop/USAGE.md) us a good place to start, as is the [Wiki](https://github.com/arcadia-unity/Arcadia/wiki). They both cover how to get started and all the prerequisites you'll need. The community on the [Gitter](https://gitter.im/arcadia-unity/Arcadia) is very helpful and happy to answer questions. 

### REPL
Arcadia ships with a simple networked REPL that is started automatically or from `Clojure > REPL > Start`. To integrate your text editor with Arcadia, there are a few clients listed on [the Wiki](https://github.com/arcadia-unity/Arcadia/wiki/Resources). Additionally, there are three command line scripts that act as REPL clients if that makes your integration easier. `Editor/repl-client.rb`, `Editor/repl-client.javascript`, and `Infrastructure/repl`. `Infrastructure/repl` is the future, but not totally stable yet. You should try them all and use what works best.

The core devs use the REPL from [Emacs (via Inferior Lisp)](https://github.com/arcadia-unity/arcadia/wiki/Editor-support#emacs) and [SublimeText (via Socket)](https://github.com/nasser/Socket).

Name
-----
This project was originally named "clojure-unity", but was changed to "Arcadia" to avoid infinging on Clojure's trademarks. It was suggested to us by @ztellman at a bar during StrangeLoop 2014, and we are eternally grateful.
